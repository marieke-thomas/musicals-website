                <h1>Top 10 Musicals</h1>
                <p>Here is my (completely subjective) list of the top 10 Broadway musicals of all time</p>
                <div>
                    <ol class="container">
                        <div class="card"><li>Ragtime</li>This heartbreaking musical chronicles the lives of three different families-- one working-class black, one upper-crust white, and one poor Jewish immigrant-- as they each strive to live out their vision of the American Dream. Set in turn-of-the-century New York, the show explores the complex themes of racism and violence through vivid storytelling and a sweeping, emotional score.</div>
                        <div class="card"><li>Next to Normal</li>This musical features Diana, a bipolar housewife, along with her steadfast husband, sarcastic daughter, and suggestive son. The show grapples with heavy subject matter in a deeply personal, darkly humerous way.</div>
                        <div class="card"><li>The Last 5 Years</li>This sparse, 2-person show recounts a 5-year romantic relationship while reaturing a non-chronological storyline and a beautiful score.</div>
                        <div class="card"><li>Legally Blonde</li>This hilarious, peppy show features Elle Woods, a blonde sorority sister who stalks her ex all the way to Harvard Law School. Don't be fooled by the pink paybill and goofy opening-- this musical is a genuinely touching piece of feminist theater.</div>
                        <div class="card"><li>Evita</li>Andrew Lloyd Webber's tale of the populist Argentine first lady features passion, super-stardom, and some of the snarkiest lines ever penned for musical theater.</div>
                        <div class="card"><li>Rent</li>Despite the fact that every major character in this show is a terrible person, it still makes the list due to it's phenomenal rock score which poignantly captures the terror of living with AIDS in 1989 New York.</div>
                        <div class="card"><li>Wicked</li>No one mourns the wicked! See <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> told from the point of view of the Wicked Witch. Watch as a young, green Elphaba struggles to find her place in a dystopian fantasy world.</div>
                        <div class="card"><li>Hamilton</li>Like Rent, this show overcomes a somewhat unlikeable lead on the strength of its groundbreaking score. Every song is an individual masterpiece, but the true strength of the show rests on its musical variety (from straight rap to smooth ballads to Beatles-esque pop) and the way each lyric perfectly musically embodies the character singing it. </div>
                        <div class="card"><li>Les Miserables</li>This classic details the lives of the poor in nineteenth-century France with music ranging from "Do You Hear the People Sing?", a revolutionary march, to famously moving ballads ("On My Own", "I Dreamed a Dream").</div>
                        <div class="card"><li>The Secret Garden</li>Based on the classic children's book, this musical adds new depth to the story by adding background to Archibald, who struggles to care for his orphaned niece while being hautend by the ghosts of his past.</div>
                        <div class="card"><h2>Honorable Mention: Spring Awakening</h2>While the musical itself is fine but unremarkable, it gets an honorable mention for the Deaf West production, which is by far the best-directed show I have seen on Broadway. This tale of teenagers struggling to express themselves to adults takes on added dimensions in a production featuring actors who sign rather than sing.</div>
